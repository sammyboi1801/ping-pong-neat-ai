# Ping Pong AI using neat algorithm

Created a multiplayer ping pong game and then trained an AI using the NEAT algorithm.

Training the AI took 2 hours. The player has information of it's own position and the distance between the ping pong ball and player as another attribute to the ai. The AI learns the optimum steps to take and in which direction for it to score maximum points.

The Red one is the AI and the yellow one is the player
